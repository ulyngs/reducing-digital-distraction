# Track yourself {.tabset}
## See how your spend your time
Various tools are available to see how your spend time on your devices, and compare it to your goals.

On **laptop**, one of the most popular tools is [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com): 

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rescue_time.png")
```

<br>

### Android
On **Android**, apps such as [Usage Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agooday.screentime&hl=en&gl=us) provide the same functionality:

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/app_usage.png")
```

<br>

Google provides the same functionality with [Digital Wellbeing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en_GB), which is pre-installed on many newer Android devices (Settings > Digital Wellbeing):

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/digi_wellbeing.jpeg")
```

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}

## Work in bursts with a timer
To keep you on track, many people track themselves with a countdown timer.
This is often done with the 'Pomodoro' technique, where you break your work down in intervals, typically 25 minutes, separated by short breaks.

### Laptop
Numerous tools support this, for example [Be Focused](https://xwavesoft.com/be-focused-pro-for-iphone-ipad-mac-os-x.html):

```{r, out.width="30%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/pomodoro.png")
```

<br>

You can combine this with blocking distracting websites during work sessions, for example using the Chrome extension [FocusMe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focusme-a-pomodoro-timer/koebbleaefghpjjmghelhjboilcmfpad?hl=gb):

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/focusme.png")
```

### Android

```{r, out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/its_study_time2.png")
```
