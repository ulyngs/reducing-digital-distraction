# Track yourself {.tabset}
## See how your spend your time
### Laptop
One of the most popular tools for tracking your time on laptop is [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com): 

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rescue_time.png")
```

<br>

### Android
Google provides this functionality with [Digital Wellbeing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en_GB), which is pre-installed on many newer Android devices (Settings > Digital Wellbeing):

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/digi_wellbeing.jpeg")
```

Many third-party apps do the same thing, e.g. [Usage Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agooday.screentime&hl=en&gl=us):

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/app_usage.png")
```

<br>


### iOS
Apple's [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208982) functionality provides this ability on iOS (**Settings -> Screen Time**):

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/screentime.png")
```



## Work in bursts with a timer
To keep themselves on track, many people use a countdown timer.
This is often done with the 'Pomodoro' technique, where you break your work down in intervals, typically 25 minutes, separated by short breaks.

### Laptop
Numerous tools support this, for example [Be Focused](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470?mt=12):

```{r, out.width="30%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/pomodoro.png")
```

<br>


Some website blockers also include Pomodoro timer functionality, for example the **Chrome** extension [FocusMe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focusme-a-pomodoro-timer/koebbleaefghpjjmghelhjboilcmfpad?hl=gb):

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/focusme.png")
```

On **Firefox** the [Pomodoro clock extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pomodoro-clock/?src=search) gives you a pomodoro timer in the browser:

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/firefox_pomodoro.png")
```


<br> 

### Android
Try e.g. [Its Study Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deGans.itsStudyTime&hl=en&gl=us):

```{r, out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/its_study_time2.png")
```

<br>

### iOS
Try e.g. [Mattie](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sidekick-mattie/id1166327958?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4):

```{r, out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/mattie.jpg")
```
