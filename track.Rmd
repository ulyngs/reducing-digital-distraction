## Work in bursts with a timer
To keep you on track, many people track themselves with a countdown timer.
This is often done with the 'Pomodoro' technique, where you break your work down in intervals, typically 25 minutes, separated by short breaks.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/pomodoro.png")
```

You can combine this with blocking distracting websites during work sessions, for example using the Chrome extension [FocusMe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focusme-a-pomodoro-timer/koebbleaefghpjjmghelhjboilcmfpad?hl=gb):

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/focusme.png")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/its_study_time2.png")
```

### iOS
