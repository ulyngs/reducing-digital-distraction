# Block or remove distractions {.tabset}
## Block access
If particular websites or apps distract you, try blocking your access to them for some time or after a certain amount of time has passed.

### Laptop
One of the best solutions, which works with all browsers, is [Cold Turkey Blocker](https://getcoldturkey.com/).

The free version can block websites; the paid version can also block applications and set up schedules.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cold_turkey_blocker.png")
```

Many, many browser extensions for specific browsers can do the same thing, e.g., ['Block Site' for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-website-blocke/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh/related?hl=en), ['Roadblock' for Safari](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.obiedcorner.Roadblock-WE58FS6Q6B), or ['Impulse Blocker' for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/impulse-blocker/?src=search).

You can find many others by searching through the extensions store for the web browser you use:

- [Safari Extensions](https://safari-extensions.apple.com)
- [Chrome Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en)
- [Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/)

### Smartphone
On **Android**, one of the most popular app blockers is [Stay Focused](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused&hl=en_GB):

```{r, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/stay_focused_block.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/stay_focused_limit.png")
#knitr::include_graphics("figures/stay_focused_options.png")
```

On **iOS**, use Apple's built-in app [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208982) to block your own access to particular apps.

- *Apply time limits*: Go to **Settings -> Screen Time -> App Limits**. Tap 'Add Limit', and either choose a category of apps to limit, search for a specific app to limit, or tap 'Websites' to restrict time on specific sites.
- *Schedule 'downtime' where only specified apps are available*: Go to **Settings -> Screen Time -> Downtime** to set schedule, and **Settings -> Screen Time -> Always Allowed** to select apps to be available during downtime


## Remove features
You can also use browser extensions to remove features of websites you find distracting.

### Facebook
#### Removing the newsfeed
On Chrome, try [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg).

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fb_newsfeed.png")
```

On Safari, try ["No Distractions" for Facebook](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/no-distractions-for-facebook/id1464306838?mt=12) which will remove the newsfeed along with other distracting elements, and turn the background white.

On iPhone, you can use [Feedless](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/feedless-newsfeed-blocker/id1339509325) to remove the newsfeed when using the Safari browser to visit Facebook (this extension can also block the feed in Instagram and Twitter).

<!-- ```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("figures/feedless.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

#### Removing numerical metrics (Chrome)
In Chrome, you can use [**Facebook Demetricator**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-demetricator/dbkgglbefgkimiadfjmgnkjmaoahephg) to remove numbers of likes etc.:

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fb-demetricator.jpg")
```

### YouTube
On **Chrome**, remove video recommentations with the extension [Remove YouTube Recommended Videos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-recommende/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid):

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/chrome_youtube.jpg")
```


On **Safari**, use ["No Distractions" for YouTube](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/no-distractions-for-youtube/id1482507016?mt=12):

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/youtube_minimal.png")
```

On **Firefox**, try [Remove Youtube's Suggestions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-youtube-s-suggestions/):

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/firefox_youtube.png")
```


### Gmail
If you use Gmail in a browser, the **Chrome** extension [Inbox When Ready](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inbox-when-ready-for-gmai/cdedhgmbfjhobfnphaoihdfmnjidcpim?hl=gb) hides your inbox by default, until you deliberately click that you wish to see it:

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inbox_ready.jpg")
```

For **Firefox**, the extension [Gmail Hide](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gmail-hide/?src=search) does the same thing:

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/firefox_gmail.png")
```


### Anything
On **Chrome**, the extension [Click to Remove Element](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/click-to-remove-element/jcgpghgjhhahcefnfpbncdmhhddedhnk?hl=gb) allows you to remove elements from any website with a single click:

```{r, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/remove_element.jpg")
```

On **Firefox**, the extension [Remove HTML Elements](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-html-elements/?src=search) does the same thing.


## Go monotasking
A few tricks can be used to reduce the functionality of your device to just those apps you need.

### Laptop
One of the currently best tools is [Micromanager](https://getcoldturkey.com/micromanager/) which allows you lock yourself into just those applications you need, for a specified amount of time:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/micromanager.png")
```



#### Writing-only
[Cold Turkey Writer](https://getcoldturkey.com/writer/) turns your laptop into a typewriter until you've typed a specific number of words, or for a specific length of time:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cold_turkey.png")
```


### Smartphone
On iOS, get the same effect using [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208982)'s 'Downtime' feature.
When 'Downtime' is scheduled, only phone calls and apps that you choose to allow are available:

```{r, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/downtime1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/downtime2.png")
```

This extension is also available for [**Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/distraction-free-google-docs/):

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/google_docs.png")
```

knitr::include_graphics("figures/word_focus2.png")
```


#### Markdown editors
