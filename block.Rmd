# Block or remove distractions {.tabset}
## Block access
If particular websites or apps distract you, try blocking your access to them for some time or after a certain amount of time has passed.

### Laptop
Many browser extensions allow you to block websites. 
Discover these by searching through the web stores for extensions for the web browser you use:
- [Safari Extensions](https://safari-extensions.apple.com)
- [Chrome Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en)
- [Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/)

The most popular website blocker for Chrome is [Block Site - Website Blocker for Chromeâ„¢](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-website-blocke/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh/related?hl=en):
```{r, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/chrome_block_setup.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/chrome_block_result.png")
```

### Smartphone
On Android, the most popular app blocker is [Stay Focused](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused&hl=en_GB):

```{r, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/stay_focused_block.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/stay_focused_limit.png")
#knitr::include_graphics("figures/stay_focused_options.png")
```

On iOS, you can use Apple's built-in app [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208982) to block your own access to particular apps.

To do so, go to **Settings -> Screen Time -> App Limits**

## Remove features
On laptop, use browser extensions to remove features of websites you find distracting.

For example, use extensions to remove Facebook's newsfeed (e.g. with Chrome's [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg)), or recommended videos from YouTube (e.g. with Safari's [Distraction Blocker for YouTube](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.robertjeffs.distractionblockerforyoutube-W9AT75TA27)):

```{r, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fb_newsfeed.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/youtube_minimal.png")
```

The Chrome extension [Click to Remove Element](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/click-to-remove-element/jcgpghgjhhahcefnfpbncdmhhddedhnk?hl=gb) allows you to remove elements from any website with a single click:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/remove_element.jpg")
```

If you use Gmail in a browser, [Inbox When Ready](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inbox-when-ready-for-gmai/cdedhgmbfjhobfnphaoihdfmnjidcpim?hl=gb) hides your inbox by default, until you deliberately click that you wish to see it:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/inbox_ready.jpg")
```

Search through the browser extension stores for a similar extension which might be useful to you:
- [Safari Extensions](https://safari-extensions.apple.com)
- [Chrome Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en)
- [Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/)

## Minimal writing tools
When you try to focus on writing, consider getting all distractions out of the way.

For smartphones, there are dedicated minimalistic writing tools such as [JotterPad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x&hl=en&gl=us):

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/jotterpad.png")
```

If you use Google Docs on laptop, there are browser extensions to make the interface super minimalistic, for example [DistractionFree for Safari](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.kallepersson.distractionfree-BBWY83BGU8):

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/google_docs.png")
```

Even Microsoft Word now includes a minimalistic 'Focus' mode:

```{r, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/word_focus1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/word_focus2.png")
```


## Go monotasking / dumbphone
A few tools can force your devices into 'monotasking' mode. 

### Laptop
[Cold Turkey Writer](https://getcoldturkey.com/writer/) allows you to turn your laptop into a typewriter until you've typed a specific number of words, or for a specific length of time:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cold_turkey.png")
```

### Smartphone
On Android, simulate a similar situation with the app [Dumbphone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.bozho.dumbphone&hl=en&gl=us):

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/dumbphone.png")
```

On iOS, get the same effect using [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208982)'s 'Downtime' feature.
When 'Downtime' is scheduled, only phone calls and apps that you choose to allow are available:

```{r, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/downtime1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("figures/downtime2.png")
```
